# Embedded Systems Lab Instructions
  
 * Teams of 2.  
	 * It is recommended to get at least one programmer and one technical person    
	 * Two good programmers or two good technical people will be a bad match
 * Clone or download a copy of [ESAL](https://github.com/drnobodyphd/ESAL) and copy the "project_template" folder to its own directory.  
 * Rename the project and make a github repository for that project only. Do not include the entire ESAL repository.  
 * Give both team members access to this repository 
 * As you go through the labs, the instructor will post issues on github, which you may/may not address.
 * In the middle of the semester, your repo will be cloned and midterm grades will be given.
 * On week 6 you will give a short presentation on the project you will be building for the rest of the semester.  The instructor will provide feedback on your design to make sure it is within scope and you can complete it on time.  
 * Demonstrations and presentations of your final project will occur during the last two weeks of class.
